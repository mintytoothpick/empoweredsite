                            Welcome to Empowered.org (Website), an interactive online service.  The mission of Empowered.org is to empower groups to mobilize for their desired social change.  From small grass-roots clubs to complex international organizations, Empowered.org provides a flexible platform to fundraise, recruit/coordinate volunteers, and create awareness for international service. As part of that effort, Empowered.org directs money to the participating organizations’ merchant processor to fund activities designated by the donor (or users of the site).  Empowered.org does not charge any set up costs or monthly fees, but if you elect to fundraise money on the Website we may receive a small percentage of each donation to administer and improve the Website if the donor elects to contribute to cover the online transactions.  Empowered.org is a wholly-owned by Global Brigades Association, a US-based not-for-profit organization.  For more information, visit <a href="http://www.globalbrigades.org" target="_blank">www.globalbrigades.org</a>.

                            Empowered.org does not seek to collect any information from or engage in any transactions with persons under the age of 13.  Our databases may nevertheless contain personal data of children under 13 due to the fact that it is not always possible to determine precisely the age of the user.  A parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 may review and request deletion of such child’s personal identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof.  If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe that he or she has disclosed personal identifiable information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@empowered.org">admin@Empowered.org</a>.

As certain Empowered.org products, services and interactive portals may allow you to manage your profile, we encourage you to access your personal data from time to time to ensure that it is correct and up-to-date.

                            While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone, via the internet or otherwise, and no technology is completely safe or “tamper” or ”hacker” proof, Empowered.org takes reasonable technical and organizational information security measures to prevent and minimize such risks.  Such measures include, where appropriate, the use of firewalls, secure servers, encryption, implementing proper access rights management systems and processes, careful selection of processors and other technically and commercially reasonable measures to provide appropriate protection for your personal data against unauthorized use or disclosure.  Where appropriate, we may also take backup copies and use other such means to prevent accidental damage or destruction to your personal data.  If a particular part of the Website supports online transactions, we will use, or ensure that our vendors use, an industry standard security measure to protect the confidentiality and security of online transactions.

Our use of cookies is intended to provide benefits to you, such as eliminating the need for you to enter your password frequently during a session or the need to re-enter items you place in a shopping cart if you do not finish a transaction in a single visit.

In some cases, especially if you wish us to delete or cease the processing of your personal data, this may also mean that we may not be able to continue to provide the services to you.
