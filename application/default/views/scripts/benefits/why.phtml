Members can join groups across regions while donors/supporters have visibility to the wide breath of activities your chapters are conducting.  Leverage a grassroots marketing strategy by allowing groups to form under your defined programs.  Empowered uniquely offers the best of both worlds: high levels of organization and coordination through admin reporting and communication tools, while enabling viral and decentralized growth through automated group and member registration and fundraising processes.  Imagine waking up in the morning with a new chapter in another country aligned to your organization page, already with members, volunteer activities and fundraising initiatives linked to your account while maintaining your secured information and remaining control of whether to disassociate with them. <em><a href="javascript:;" onclick="$('.box2less').show(); $('.box2more').hide();">Read less</a></em></h3>

							<h3 class="box3more" style="display:none;">There are two ways to “segment your market” on Empowered.  If you don’t already have a chapter model, you can create groups under your organization based on any demographic information (geographic location, interest area, year of participation, graduating class, etc.) This allows you to send targeted messaging and opportunities to those members and enable them to interact.  If you do already have a chapter model and want to segment further, you can create Program pages to do so.  For example, if you have some chapters that focus on health and others that focus on education, you can create two program pages “Health Program X” and “Education Program Y” for them to align to.  Alternatively, if you have some groups that just do Run-Walks and others that do Leadership Retreats you can keep each set of groups independent, but unified under your organization by creating unique Program pages for any and all them.  From the Program page, you can show the program’s background information and impact, automate groups to be able to start under it, pull reports and set admin controls, and collectively display all the groups associated with it to donors and current/potential members. The more programs and groups you have the wider net you cast for your mission to attract donors and members. If you’d like to learn more about the effectiveness of a chapter model, read the “Starfish and the Spider,” by Jason Saul. <em><a href="javascript:;" onclick="$('.box3less').show(); $('.box3more').hide();">Read less</a></em></h3>

							<h3 class="box4more" style="display:none;">Don’t be a once and done organization and settle for a platform that doesn’t capture past activities while promoting new ones.  Empowered allows every group page to illustrate all past volunteer activities, events and fundraising initiatives created on the platform.  This dramatically increases both your credibility to donors and provides easy ways for volunteers to engage in upcoming initiatives.  For example, Billy is participating in an upcoming activity to Ghana with your organization and creates a unique fundraising page to send out to friends and family for support.  Billy sends his page to his fiend Lana, who in turn will see not only Billy’s fundraising page, but also the pages of other volunteers participating in the activity, as well as pages for the group, the program, and your organization. With this information, Lana not only notices all the past activities of the organization, but also notices that there’s another group in her city going on an upcoming trip to Panama for her to participate in automatically. This is turning a potential supporter into a donor or participating volunteer instantaneously.   <em><a href="javascript:;" onclick="$('.box4less').show(); $('.box4more').hide();">Read less</a></em></h3>
