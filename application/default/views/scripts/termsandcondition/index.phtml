                            The mission of Empowered.org is to empower groups to mobilize for their desired social change.  From small grass-roots clubs to complex international organizations, Empowered.org provides a flexible platform to fundraise, recruit/coordinate volunteers, and create awareness for international service. As part of that effort, Empowered.org directs money to the participating organizations’ merchant processor to fund activities designated by the donor (or users of the site).  Empowered.org does not charge any set up costs or monthly fees, but if you elect to fundraise money on the Website we may receive a small percentage of each donation to administer and improve the Website if the donor elects to contribute to cover the online transactions.  Empowered.org is a wholly-owned by *Global Brigades Association (Global Brigades), a US-based not-for-profit organization.
