                            <p>The Empowered are not concerned with borders and countries, but humanity.<br /><br />
							Their impact is not measured in words and pictures, it radiates in the lives in which they touch.<br /><br />
							Their message is not self promoting, but spreads virally for the awareness of social change. <br /><br />
							When they mobilize without creed or credit, great work is done.

                            <p>There are many names for those with similar objectives.<br /><br />  
							Trying to further distinguish, they inevitably grow closer.<br /><br />
							Social progress spreads with the nameless, working seamlessly toward their mission.<br /><br />
							Caring little for titles, the Empowered remain focused on ideal outcomes.</p>

							The health of the organization comes over wealth for stakeholders.<br /><br />
							Profit is distributed to perpetuate the mission, while costs are limited to create value.<br /><br />
							Net worth is calculated by net value to the whole society.
