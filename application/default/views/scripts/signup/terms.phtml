        <strong>Global Brigades: Accident Waiver and Release of Liability Form</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to be able to participate in the brigade to Central America or Ghana offered by Global Brigades USA, Global Brigades UK, Global Brigades Ireland, Global Brigades Switzerland, Global Brigades Germany, Global Brigades Canada, Fundacion Brigadas Globales de Panama, Global Brigades Ghana, Asociacion Global Brigadas de Honduras, or Fundacion Brigadas de Nicaragua (hereafter collectively referred to as *“Global Brigades”), I hereby agree to the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>I am 18 years of age or older and I understand this is a legal document.</li>
        <li>I have read the Global Brigades Ethics Policy (transcribed below) and will adhere to it.  I will act with the utmost respect for the culture and community that I will be serving and not directly conduct services that I am not certified to participate in.</li>
        <li>I understand that the possession, use, sale, distribution or production of narcotics or other illegal drugs, or acting as an accessory, liaison or facilitator for any of the above, will not be tolerated and will result in my being immediately terminated from the brigade without any reimbursement or compensation.  I understand it is my responsibility to know the local laws.  I will not consume alcohol so as to impact others around me or to impede my ability to participate in brigade activities.  I understand that it is my responsibility to report any violations of the policies set forth in this paragraph as well as to report any other actions that may be harmful to the group or to staff.</li>
        <li>I understand that I may be dismissed from the brigade and turned over to local law enforcement should I violate the local law of the host community or country.  I also understand that there is zero tolerance for any violent behavior or possession of any weapon or any aggression or perceived aggression and that my engaging in any such actions will result in automatic and immediate dismissal from the brigade.</li>
        <li>I understand that sexual relations and expectations within local cultures are different and should be respected.  I will maintain a high level of professionalism and I will not develop or engage in intimate relationships while conducting international volunteer activities with Global Brigades.  Sexual misconduct is disruptive to the brigade and potentially offensive to the host culture and similarly merits dismissal.</li>
        <li>I understand there are risks involved with international travel and I understand the nature of the brigade on which I am to embark.  I have been given the opportunity to ask questions about the brigade and about travel to and from my ultimate destination.  I am not required to participate in the brigade but I want to do so, despite the risks my participation entails. </li>
        <li>I understand that participation in the brigade will take me away from home for an extended period of time. I understand that I will be in unfamiliar surroundings and that I will be exposed to risks to my person and possessions.  I understand there are hazards and risks inherent in travel and in the activities in the brigade, including but not limited to: political, social, and economic conditions which are different than in my home country and which can change in an unpredictable manner; differing standards of design, safety, and maintenance of buildings, hygiene, sanitation, public spaces, and transportation; varying quality of available medical treatment and differing health, safety, legal, cultural, and religious beliefs and conditions; homesickness and loneliness; kidnapping; violence and crime; civil unrest; all of which could cause serious personal injury or loss of life to me and/or loss or damage to me or my property.  I understand that communication in different regional or international locations can be difficult and in the event of an accident, rescue and medical treatment may not be available.  I understand that weather conditions may be extreme and can change rapidly and without warning, making travel by any means hazardous.  I acknowledge and accept that Global Brigades may be unable to predict whether the foreign location used is safe for travel at a given time.  I understand that human error; failure to forecast or recognize a hazardous situation; negligence of other travelers or local residents; and negligence on the part of other students or of Global Brigades, including the failure of Global Brigades to safeguard or protect me from risks, dangers, and hazards, may result in personal injury, death, property damage or losses resulting therefrom.  <br />Nonetheless, I freely and voluntarily accept and assume all risks for such personal injury, loss of life, or property loss or damage.</li>
        <li>To mitigate the risks associated with travel and immersion into another culture, such as any violent, sexual or other assaults, I hereby agree that I will remain with my group at all times.  I understand that I am expected to participate in all planned brigade activities unless there are health issues preventing my participation. </li>
        <li>I represent and warrant that I will be covered by a policy of comprehensive health and accident insurance providing coverage for injuries and illnesses I sustain or experience during travel outside the United States, and that this policy will be in force during the entire period of my travels and for the duration of the brigade in which I will be participating.  I understand that Global Brigades may not have medical professionals available during transportation or anywhere in the foreign countries being visited and that Global Brigades is not responsible for any medical expense I may incur while abroad.  I also acknowledge that Global Brigades may not carry accident, injury, evacuation, or health insurance for my benefit and also that there may be certain matters for which I could be held personally at fault, if the accompanying circumstances do not relate to, or arise from, my education, or if my activities do not meet what could be considered a reasonable standard for an individual in my position or otherwise.  I agree to be accountable in all respects for my own actions and I will not hold Global Brigades to be accountable for my actions.  I acknowledge that I have been advised by Global Brigades of the risks and dangers of my participating in the brigade and of the need for me to act responsibly at all times.  I recognize that Global Brigades is not providing personal chaperones during my participation in the brigade. </li>
        <li>I understand the risks of disease in the regions in which I am traveling.  I have visited a doctor and I have received and/or taken appropriate vaccinations and anti-malarial medicine to minimize my chances of infection.  While Global Brigades will do everything it reasonably can to create a safe environment for you, I understand that Global Brigades cannot prevent illness or infections while I am traveling and therefore I absolve Global Brigades from any responsibility or liability for any illness I incur during the brigade or while traveling to or from it unless such illness or infection is due to Global Brigades’ gross negligence.  I am physically fit and no medical professional has advised me not to participate.  I do not have any health-related reasons or problems precluding my participating in the brigade.  I hereby consent to receive medical treatment which may be deemed advisable in the event of injury, accident, and/or illness during my time in the brigade or while traveling to or from it.  </li>
        <li><u>Discipline Policy:</u> If I violate any of the aforementioned policies or procedures, Global Brigades may, at its sole discretion, require me to return immediately to the United States.  In such event, no refund will be made and I will bear any costs associated with the decision to require me to leave.  In its sole discretion and for any reason, Global Brigades may cancel the brigade at any time and may at any time require all participants return to the United States.  In such event, no refund will be made and I will bear my share of any costs associated with the decision to cancel the brigade and return to the United States.

    <p>
        Global Brigade does not promote underage drinking of alcoholic beverages; however, we are aware that under Honduran/Panamanian/Nicaragua law, the legal drinking age is eighteen (18) years.  If the volunteer decides to consume alcoholic beverages in Honduras, Nicaragua or Panama, they understand that they will do so responsibly and accept restraint from the supervising host organization.  If by circumstance any volunteer acts inappropriately, they understand that disciplinary action may be taken at the discretion of the supervising staff and said volunteer may be sent home to the United States or their country of origin at their own expense.  The signed form is confidential between Global Brigades, its nonprofit partners and the signee and will only be used to protect the liability of the parties mentioned in case of incident.
